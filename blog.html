                        Local Storage: This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session). <br> <br>

                        Session Storage:

                        Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                        Local Variable:
                        Local Variable is defined as a type of variable declared within programming block or subroutines. It can only be used inside the subroutine or code block in which it is declared. The local variable exists until the block of the function is under execution. After that, it will be destroyed automatically. <br> <br>
                        A Global Variable:
                        A Global Variable in the program is a variable defined outside the subroutine or function. It has a global scope means it holds its value throughout the lifetime of the program. Hence, it can be accessed throughout the program by any function defined within the program, unless it is shadowed.

                        The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

                        Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback

                        In this article, we are going to learn about Template literals. There are different kinds of literals in JavaScript, like the Object Literals and Boolean Literals. We also have String Literals which are indicated by single quotes ‘ ‘ or double quotes ” “. 

                        Starting from ES6 (ECMAScript 6), we have Template Literals which are indicated by the backtick (` `) character. Template literals help us to write clean code. It is also called a Template string.
